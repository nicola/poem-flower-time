# POEM: Flower time

> Time changes how we look, not who we are

## What is it?

This is a code poem, you can visualize it here: [see visualization](http://nicola.io/poem-flower-time).

As soon as you land on the page, a grid of 7*7 flowers is displayed.
These are different flowers, mathematically generated.

After waiting a couple of seconds, colourful shades appear in the background. These keep the structure of the flowers, but change in shape. As time pass, we *change how we look, not who we are*.

By touching the flowers, we can visualize the difference between the structure and the content changing shape through time, mantaining the colors and the structure.
